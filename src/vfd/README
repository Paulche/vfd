This is code originally written by Alex Zelezniak (AT&T Labs).

It provides a daemon that configures PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.  This includes the ability to:

	- ensure antispoofing (MAC and VLAN) is enabled
	- set a list of MAC addresses which are associated with the guest
	- set a list of VLAN IDs which the guest is allowed to receive traffic for
	- enable/disable VLAN ID strip/insert
	- enable/disable broadcast/mcast/un-unicast


Future support for mirroring is planned.

The daemon (VFD) has been extended to:
	- read single configuration files as provided by nova (future)
	- read all configuration files on restart (future)
	- read requests from a named FIFO (future)
