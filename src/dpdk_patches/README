This directory contains patches that must be applied against DPDK in order to 
support VFd.  These patches, along with the command(s) to apply them to DPDK 
should be described below.  Patches will be removed from this directory when 
they are available in the current DPDK release. 

We assume that VFD_PATH is the path to the VFd src directory.

dpdk-dev-net-ixgbe-fix-VF-RX-hang.patch
cd $RTE_SDK
git apply --whitesapace=fix $VFD_PATH/dpdk_patches/dpdk-dev-net-ixgbe-fix-VF-RX-hang.patch


dpdk-ixgbe_pf_host_configure.patch
This patch prevents the PF code in DPDK from returning a failure indication when a 
set macvlan callback is made.  This is a work around; the final fix in DPDK will be 
more complex

cd $RTE_SDK
git apply --ignore-whitespace $VFD_PATH/dpdk_patches/dpdk-ixgbe_pf_host_configure.patch
